## Description

I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

AFter the button "generate password" is pressed, the user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters ([see examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters))

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters


Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts.

As a bonus, the user has the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.

The application was built with bootsraps so it will be able to work on different devices with no real size restraints.
